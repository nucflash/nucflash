    <p>Today marks my first day at Apple! I’ve joined the Apple Speech Recognition team within Siri, part of the AI/ML (Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning) organization. After 12 wonderful years in Amsterdam, I’ve relocated to Cupertino, California, in the United States. I’m thrilled to be working at Apple Park, one of the most iconic and beautiful buildings in the world. Excited for the journey ahead!</p>

                <h3 id="abstract">Abstract</h3>
<p>We focus on improving the effectiveness of a Virtual Assistant (VA) in recognizing emerging entities in spoken queries. We introduce a method that uses historical user interactions to forecast which entities will gain in popularity and become trending, and it subse- quently integrates the predictions within the Automated Speech Recognition (ASR) component of the VA. Experiments show that our proposed approach results in a 20% relative reduction in errors on emerging entity name utterances without degrading the overall recognition quality of the system.</p>
<p>Happy to share the news about my first joint pubication with the Siri Speech team at Apple. Our short paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.12816">Predicting Entity Popularity to Improve Spoken Entity Recognition by Virtual Assistants</a> with Christophe van Gysel, myself, Ernie Pusateri, and Ilya Oparin, is accepted at SIGIR 2020.</p>

<p>I was happy to be invited at <a href="http://frankfurt-data-science.com">Frankfurt Data Science meetup</a> to talk about data science, meetups, and how to build a data science-oriented startup. The event was held at <a href="http://www.frankfurt-school.de/en/home">Frankfurt School</a> on <a href="https://www.meetup.com/FankfutDataScience/events/247415610/">March 1<sup>st</sup>, 2018</a>. In my talk I gave an overview of the meetup scene in Amsterdam, briefly presented <a href="http://amsterdamdatascience.nl">Amsterdam Data Science</a> and its activites, and then I shared my experiences on founding and developing <a href="http://904labs.com">904Labs</a>, before I delved into one of my favorite topics: machine learning and search.</p>

                <p>On 31 May, I was invited to give a talk at <a href="https://www.meetup.com/TECH-Talks-Meetup-Amsterdam/">TECH Talks in Amsterdam</a>. TECH Talks is a new meetup organized by <a href="https://techloop.io">Techloop.io</a>, a new way for matching jobs and talent in IT. My talk revolved on how we built an e-commerce focused search engine using machine learning (or as most people know it, A.I.). The meetup had a great start with more than 200 registered people and more than 100 people showed up; the room at TQ was at its maximum capacity! The audience was diverse with a nice mix of frontend, backend , senior and junior engineers, and also people from other disciplines who are interested in keeping up with latest developments in IT and e-commerce. Techloop and TQ were great organizers providing a great atmosphere (pizza and beer, included) facilitating great chats and networks afterwards.</p>
<p>You can see the video of the talks here (mine is the first after the introduction by Techloop):</p>

<p>Dr. Manos Tsagkias (or Manos Tsagias; Μάνος Τσαγκιάς) is a Greek Machine Learning Scientist. Manos has more than 15 years of experience in building production ready, scalable systems for speech, search, recommendation, and predictive analytics. With a Ph.D. in Machine Learning and a strong foundation in Physics, Manos has founded three companies: 904Labs, the world’s first self-learning product search engine offered as a service; Solumbro, which introduced the first solar-powered umbrella with a virtual assistant; and MyYard, the first cloud-based ERP system for the waste management industry. As an academic, Manos&rsquo; research has earned an H-index of 20, with over 55 published papers. Manos has co-supervised a Ph.D. thesis and mentored more than 10 master’s theses. Currently, Manos is an R&amp;D Engineer at Apple, tackling virtual assistants at the challenging intersection of speech and search.</p>
