<p>I was happy to be invited at <a href="http://frankfurt-data-science.com">Frankfurt Data Science meetup</a> to talk about data science, meetups, and how to build a data science-oriented startup. The event was held at <a href="http://www.frankfurt-school.de/en/home">Frankfurt School</a> on <a href="https://www.meetup.com/FankfutDataScience/events/247415610/">March 1<sup>st</sup>, 2018</a>. In my talk I gave an overview of the meetup scene in Amsterdam, briefly presented <a href="http://amsterdamdatascience.nl">Amsterdam Data Science</a> and its activites, and then I shared my experiences on founding and developing <a href="http://904labs.com">904Labs</a>, before I delved into one of my favorite topics: machine learning and search.</p>
<p>It was a packed room, with more than 200 registered people for the event, and the talk was broadcasted live on YouTube. There will soon be a video, which I will share here. The audience was from diverse backgrounds, and I enjoyed the interactions very much. I was happily surprised by the professional organization of the event, and the ambition for making Frankfurt one of the leading centres in data science in Europe. All the best to the organizers and I hope to see more collaboration on data science between Frankfurt and Amsterdam in the near future!</p>

                <p>On 31 May, I was invited to give a talk at <a href="https://www.meetup.com/TECH-Talks-Meetup-Amsterdam/">TECH Talks in Amsterdam</a>. TECH Talks is a new meetup organized by <a href="https://techloop.io">Techloop.io</a>, a new way for matching jobs and talent in IT. My talk revolved on how we built an e-commerce focused search engine using machine learning (or as most people know it, A.I.). The meetup had a great start with more than 200 registered people and more than 100 people showed up; the room at TQ was at its maximum capacity! The audience was diverse with a nice mix of frontend, backend , senior and junior engineers, and also people from other disciplines who are interested in keeping up with latest developments in IT and e-commerce. Techloop and TQ were great organizers providing a great atmosphere (pizza and beer, included) facilitating great chats and networks afterwards.</p>

<p>This year we were invited to be part of A.I. Expo Europe, held in Amsterdam. The organizers were very kind to offer us a free booth in the Startup zone of the exhibition. The event took place on 27 and 28 June 2018, and it was packed with talks and visitors. There were three tracks: A.I., IoT, and Blockchain, with the latter two dominating the exhibitors list.</p>

It was fun to be among A.I. enthusiasts and to see that people identified with our experiences–which means that we are on good track!</p>

                <p>The Dutch-Belgian Information Retrieval Workshop was held this year in Delft. A nice lot of people from all around the Netherlands, Belgium, and a handful from abroad came together to share their research highlights from this year. It was a nice programme, filled with interesting short talks (about 15mins) that were great to give us a summary of what everybody is working on.</p>
<p>My personal highlight was Chato&rsquo;s keynote speech on algorithmic bias. Although a lot is discussed on the topic, there is yet no to little work that presents some sort of foundation that describes the issue, frames it and offers some theoretical framework from which we can start thinking about solutions. Chato&rsquo;s work laid the ground works on this area. He started with explaining what algorithmic bias is and stressed how coupled it is with data collection. I&rsquo;m looking forward to seeing more on his work on the subject.</p>

                <p>In my talk I touched upon a bunch of challenges we&rsquo;ve faced at 904Labs and how we came about to solving them. Open questions revolve around online learning to rank algorithms, delayed feedback, design of new metrics to avoid embarassing results, and the importance of investing in an evaluation platform. At 904Labs we have come a long way and we have working answers for these questions, however, as these questions are particularly difficult to answer, I&rsquo;ve invited people to drop me a note with ideas, if they are interested. I&rsquo;ve already got some nice feedback, and I hope to see more research on these areas in the near future!</p>

<p>I design scalable systems for speech, search, recommendation, and predictive analytics, combining theory with elegant engineering to enhance user experiences. With a Ph.D. in Machine Learning and a strong foundation in Physics, I have founded three companies: MyYard, the first cloud-based ERP system for the waste management industry; 904Labs, the world’s first self-learning product search engine offered as a service; and Solumbro, which introduced the first solar-powered umbrella with a virtual assistant. As an academic, my research has earned an H-index of 20, with over 55 published papers. I have co-supervised a Ph.D. thesis and guided more than 10 master’s theses. Currently, I’m an R&amp;D Engineer at Apple, tackling virtual assistants at the challenging intersection of speech and search.</p>
