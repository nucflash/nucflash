    <p>The Dutch-Belgian Information Retrieval Workshop was held this year in Delft. A nice lot of people from all around the Netherlands, Belgium, and a handful from abroad came together to share their research highlights from this year. It was a nice programme, filled with interesting short talks (about 15mins) that were great to give us a summary of what everybody is working on.</p>
<p>My personal highlight was Chato&rsquo;s keynote speech on algorithmic bias. Although a lot is discussed on the topic, there is yet no to little work that presents some sort of foundation that describes the issue, frames it and offers some theoretical framework from which we can start thinking about solutions. Chato&rsquo;s work laid the ground works on this area. He started with explaining what algorithmic bias is and stressed how coupled it is with data collection. I&rsquo;m looking forward to seeing more on his work on the subject.</p>

<p>European Conference on Information Retrieval (ECIR) is a annual European scientific conference around bhe topics of search engines, recommender systems, text analytics, user modeling, and evaluation. <a href="http://ecir2018.org">This year ECIR was held in Grenoble, France.</a> With more than 250 attendants and 4 days packed with tutorials, workshops, research, and industry talks, it was a great place to be to get updated with the latest and greatest about search engines.</p>
<p>The theme of this year&rsquo;s Industry Day was to bring lessons learned from industry to academia. What are differences when developing a research algorithm and when we bring to practice? These lessons could inspire and inform our fellow academics for the challenges practitioners face when bring these algorithms to production.</p>

<p>I was happy to be invited at <a href="http://frankfurt-data-science.com">Frankfurt Data Science meetup</a> to talk about data science, meetups, and how to build a data science-oriented startup. The event was held at <a href="http://www.frankfurt-school.de/en/home">Frankfurt School</a> on <a href="https://www.meetup.com/FankfutDataScience/events/247415610/">March 1<sup>st</sup>, 2018</a>. In my talk I gave an overview of the meetup scene in Amsterdam, briefly presented <a href="http://amsterdamdatascience.nl">Amsterdam Data Science</a> and its activites, and then I shared my experiences on founding and developing <a href="http://904labs.com">904Labs</a>, before I delved into one of my favorite topics: machine learning and search.</p>

<p><a href="http://ai2future.com">AI2Future</a> is a local, Croatian, initiative for disseminating the importance and for grounding the use of Artificial Intelligence. The conference brings together researchers, A.I. start ups, and large corporates from all around Croatia to share experiences and learn from each other on what A.I. can and cannot do.</p>
<p>I was invited to give one of the two keynote talks. The first keynote focused on conversational agents and natural language processing and mine followed up with insights how search powers a large spectrum of applications from search, question and answering, and recommendations. I focused on the work we do at 904Labs and illustrated the principles of online learning to rank through real-world examples from our experimences with our customers.</p>

For the clustering task, our focus was on replicating the lessons learned at WEPS1 on the data set made available as part of WEPS2 and on experimenting with a voting-based combination of clustering methods. We found that clustering methods display the same overall behavior on the WEPS1 and WESP2 data sets and that a hierarchical clustering approach delivers the best performance, even outperforming voting-based combinations. For attribute extraction, we explore approaches using pattern matching with manually and automatically constructed patterns. Manual patterns were constructed using expert knowledge and following analysis of sample data. Automatic pattern construction extracts textual and syntactic context around training samples and selects patterns which are expected to perform well based on leave-one-out evaluation. Experimental results show that</p>
