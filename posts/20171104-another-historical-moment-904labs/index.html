    <p>I&rsquo;m very happy to share news on the latest success of <a href="https://904labs.com">904Labs A.I. for Search</a> with our new customer, <a href="https://eci.nl">eci.nl</a>.</p>
<p>eci is one of the largest online book specialists in the Netherlands and Belgium, with an estimated yearly revenue of 15m euro for the Dutch part. For their site search, eci relied on a manually optimized Apache Solr, integrated into Intershop.</p>
<p>During a three-week A/B test we&rsquo;ve shown a <em>38% improvement in revenue and a 34% increase in conversion rate</em> compared to the in-house Apache Solr search engine. This shows once more that adding A.I. to your search engine really makes a difference! <a href="https://www.904labs.com/en/eci-increases-revenue-substantially-with-ai-for-search">Read the full story here.</a></p>

                <p>It was an intense two days, with lots of people dropping by 904Labs&rsquo; booth and asking about what we do and how 904Labs search technology can help them in their settings. Altough the average visitor profile was not looking for onsite search, we had good chats with a bunch of Dutch and international and small, medium, and big companies on how onsite search can help their endeavors. We talked on how search technology is underneath many applications, including chatbots, and self-service</p>
