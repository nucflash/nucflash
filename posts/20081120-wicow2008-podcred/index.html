<p>The PodCred framework is a framework for assessing the credibility and quality of podcasts published on the internet. It consists of a series of indicators designed to support prediction of listener preference of one podcast over another, given that both carry comparable informational content. The indicators are grouped into four categories pertaining to the Podcast Content, the Podcaster, the Podcast Context or the Technical Execution of the podcast. We adopt the term &ldquo;cred&rdquo; as a designation encompassing both credibility (comprising trustworthiness and expertise) and qualitative acceptability to listeners. Our podcast analysis framework is inspired by work on credibility in blogs, another medium dominated by user generated content. The PodCred framework is derived from a review of the literature on credibility for other media, a survey of prescriptive standards for podcasting, and a detailed data analysis of award winning podcasts. The paper concludes with a discussion of future work in which the framework will be applied.</p>

<p>Podcasts display an unevenness characteristic of domains dominated by user generated content, resulting in potentially radical variation of the user preference they enjoy. We report on work that uses easily extractable surface features of podcasts in order to achieve solid performance on two podcast preference prediction tasks: classification of preferred vs. non-preferred podcasts and ranking podcasts by level of preference. We identify features with good discriminative potential by carrying out manual data analysis, resulting in a refinement of the indicators of an existent podcast preference framework. Our preference prediction is useful for topic-independent ranking of podcasts, and can be used to support download suggestion or collection browsing.</p>

<p>Streamwatchr (2013–2016), developed at the University of Amsterdam, leveraged machine learning and named entity extraction to track global music listening behavior in real time through tweets. It offered features like Top-100 charts, interactive maps, and a “radio” stream mode driven by a dynamic recommender system. Using Python and MongoDB, it processed over 438 million tweets, identified 660,941 artists, and linked them to MusicBrainz and YouTube videos. This innovative blend of analytics and entity linking earned it a spot in the Dutch delegation at South by Southwest (SXSW).</p>
<p>Streamwatchr (2013&ndash;2016) was a web application developed at the University of Amsterdam, by Wouter Weerkamp, Maarten de Rijke, and myself. Streamwatchr monitored the Twitter feed for #nowplaying, and  tracked how people interacted with songs, artists, albums, in real-time. In its latest version it also identified which parts of the lyrics were the most sung along!</p>

                <p>The Dutch-Belgian Information Retrieval Workshop was held this year in Delft. A nice lot of people from all around the Netherlands, Belgium, and a handful from abroad came together to share their research highlights from this year. It was a nice programme, filled with interesting short talks (about 15mins) that were great to give us a summary of what everybody is working on.</p>
<p>My personal highlight was Chato&rsquo;s keynote speech on algorithmic bias. Although a lot is discussed on the topic, there is yet no to little work that presents some sort of foundation that describes the issue, frames it and offers some theoretical framework from which we can start thinking about solutions. Chato&rsquo;s work laid the ground works on this area. He started with explaining what algorithmic bias is and stressed how coupled it is with data collection. I&rsquo;m looking forward to seeing more on his work on the subject.</p>

<p>On-line news agents provide commenting facilities for readers to express their views with regard to news stories. The number of user supplied comments on a news article may be indicative of its importance or impact. We report on exploratory work that predicts the comment volume of news articles prior to publication using five feature sets. We address the prediction task as a two stage classification task: a binary classification identifies articles with the potential to receive comments, and a second binary classification receives the output from the first step to label articles &ldquo;low&rdquo; or &ldquo;high&rdquo; comment volume. The results show solid performance for the former task, while performance degrades for the latter.</p>

<p>User generated spoken audio remains a challenge for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) technology and content-based audio surrogates derived from ASR-transcripts must be error robust. An investigation of the use of term clouds as surrogates for podcasts demonstrates that ASR term clouds closely approximate term clouds derived from human-generated transcripts across a range of cloud sizes. A user study confirms the conclusion that ASR-clouds are viable surrogates for depicting the content of podcasts.</p>
