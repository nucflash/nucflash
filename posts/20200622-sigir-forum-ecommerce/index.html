<p>With the rapid adoption of online shopping, academic research in the eCommerce domain has gained traction. However, significant research challenges remain, spanning from classic eCommerce search problems such as matching textual queries to multi-modal documents and ranking optimization for two-sided marketplaces to human-computer interaction and recom- mender systems for discovery and browsing. These research areas are important for under- standing customer behavior, driving engagement, and improving product discoverability and conversion. In this article we identify the challenges and highlight research opportunities to improve the eCommerce customer experience.</p>
<p>As eCommerce is becoming increasingly important, we recruited a small team of researchers from major and not so major players in the field to share views and experiences on theoretical and practical challenges and future directions on eCommerce search and recommendations. The result of our effort, <a href="http://sigir.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/p04.pdf">Challenges and Research Opportunities in eCommerce Search and Recommendations</a> is published in <a href="http://sigir.org/forum/issues/june-2020/">June 2020 issue of SIGIR Forum</a>.</p>
<p>This work is related to <a href="../20190718-ecommerce-workshop/">thoughts that I shared earlier on product search</a>, and to <a href="../20180618-query-engine/">904Labs&rsquo; Query Intent engine</a> and its <a href="../20180618-query-engine-upgrade/">magnificent results (examples)</a>.</p>

                <p>The Dutch-Belgian Information Retrieval Workshop was held this year in Delft. A nice lot of people from all around the Netherlands, Belgium, and a handful from abroad came together to share their research highlights from this year. It was a nice programme, filled with interesting short talks (about 15mins) that were great to give us a summary of what everybody is working on.</p>
<p>My personal highlight was Chato&rsquo;s keynote speech on algorithmic bias. Although a lot is discussed on the topic, there is yet no to little work that presents some sort of foundation that describes the issue, frames it and offers some theoretical framework from which we can start thinking about solutions. Chato&rsquo;s work laid the ground works on this area. He started with explaining what algorithmic bias is and stressed how coupled it is with data collection. I&rsquo;m looking forward to seeing more on his work on the subject.</p>

<p>Modeling user browsing behavior is an active research area with
tangible real-world applications, e.g., organizations can adapt
their online presence to their visitors browsing behavior with
positive effects in user engagement, and revenue. We concentrate on
online news agents, and present a semi-supervised method for
predicting news articles that a user will visit after reading an
initial article. Our method tackles the problem using language
intent models trained on historical data which can cope
with unseen articles. We evaluate our method on a large set of
articles and in several experimental settings. Our results
demonstrate the utility of language intent models for predicting
user browsing behavior within online news sites.</p>
