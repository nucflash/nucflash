<p>This year we were invited to be part of A.I. Expo Europe, held in Amsterdam. The organizers were very kind to offer us a free booth in the Startup zone of the exhibition. The event took place on 27 and 28 June 2018, and it was packed with talks and visitors. There were three tracks: A.I., IoT, and Blockchain, with the latter two dominating the exhibitors list.</p>
<p>It was an intense two days, with lots of people dropping by 904Labs&rsquo; booth and asking about what we do and how 904Labs search technology can help them in their settings. Altough the average visitor profile was not looking for onsite search, we had good chats with a bunch of Dutch and international and small, medium, and big companies on how onsite search can help their endeavors. We talked on how search technology is underneath many applications, including chatbots, and self-service applications. No matter the application, good search can help increase revenue in the setting of selling products, or reduce costs in the setting of self-service as visitors are better able to find the information they&rsquo;re looking for without calling the company&rsquo;s call centre.</p>
<p>Besides core business, it was nice to see other startups and non-startups from Amsterdam and catch up with old faces and meet new ones. Overall, it was a fun experience. A big thanks to the A.I. Expo Europe organizers for inviting us over!</p>

                <p>On 31 May, I was invited to give a talk at <a href="https://www.meetup.com/TECH-Talks-Meetup-Amsterdam/">TECH Talks in Amsterdam</a>. TECH Talks is a new meetup organized by <a href="https://techloop.io">Techloop.io</a>, a new way for matching jobs and talent in IT. My talk revolved on how we built an e-commerce focused search engine using machine learning (or as most people know it, A.I.). The meetup had a great start with more than 200 registered people and more than 100 people showed up; the room at TQ was at its maximum capacity! The audience was diverse with a nice mix of frontend, backend , senior and junior engineers, and also people from other disciplines who are interested in keeping up with latest developments in IT and e-commerce. Techloop and TQ were great organizers providing a great atmosphere (pizza and beer, included) facilitating great chats and networks afterwards.</p>

                <p>In my talk I touched upon a bunch of challenges we&rsquo;ve faced at 904Labs and how we came about to solving them. Open questions revolve around online learning to rank algorithms, delayed feedback, design of new metrics to avoid embarassing results, and the importance of investing in an evaluation platform. At 904Labs we have come a long way and we have working answers for these questions, however, as these questions are particularly difficult to answer, I&rsquo;ve invited people to drop me a note with ideas, if they are interested. I&rsquo;ve already got some nice feedback, and I hope to see more research on these areas in the near future!</p>

The audience was from diverse backgrounds, and I enjoyed the interactions very much.

<p><a href="http://ai2future.com">AI2Future</a> is a local, Croatian, initiative for disseminating the importance and for grounding the use of Artificial Intelligence. The conference brings together researchers, A.I. start ups, and large corporates from all around Croatia to share experiences and learn from each other on what A.I. can and cannot do.</p>
<p>I was invited to give one of the two keynote talks. The first keynote focused on conversational agents and natural language processing and mine followed up with insights how search powers a large spectrum of applications from search, question and answering, and recommendations. I focused on the work we do at 904Labs and illustrated the principles of online learning to rank through real-world examples from our experimences with our customers.</p>
