<p>On 31 May, I was invited to give a talk at <a href="https://www.meetup.com/TECH-Talks-Meetup-Amsterdam/">TECH Talks in Amsterdam</a>. TECH Talks is a new meetup organized by <a href="https://techloop.io">Techloop.io</a>, a new way for matching jobs and talent in IT. My talk revolved on how we built an e-commerce focused search engine using machine learning (or as most people know it, A.I.). The meetup had a great start with more than 200 registered people and more than 100 people showed up; the room at TQ was at its maximum capacity! The audience was diverse with a nice mix of frontend, backend , senior and junior engineers, and also people from other disciplines who are interested in keeping up with latest developments in IT and e-commerce. Techloop and TQ were great organizers providing a great atmosphere (pizza and beer, included) facilitating great chats and networks afterwards.</p>
<p>You can see the video of the talks here (mine is the first after the introduction by Techloop):</p>

                <p>The Dutch-Belgian Information Retrieval Workshop was held this year in Delft. A nice lot of people from all around the Netherlands, Belgium, and a handful from abroad came together to share their research highlights from this year. It was a nice programme, filled with interesting short talks (about 15mins) that were great to give us a summary of what everybody is working on.</p>
