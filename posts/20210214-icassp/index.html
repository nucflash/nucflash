<p>Language models (LMs) for virtual assistants (VAs) are typically trained on large amounts of data, resulting in prohibitively large models which require excessive memory and/or cannot be used to serve user requests in real-time. Entropy pruning results in smaller models but with significant degradation of effectiveness in the tail of the user request distribution. We customize entropy pruning by allowing for a keep list of infrequent n-grams that require a more relaxed pruning threshold, and propose three methods to construct the keep list. Each method has its own advantages and disadvantages with respect to LM size, ASR accuracy and cost of constructing the keep list. Our best LM gives 8% average Word Error Rate (WER) reduction on a targeted test set, but is 3 times larger than the baseline. We also propose discriminative methods to reduce the size of the LM while retaining the majority of the WER gains achieved by the largest LM.</p>
<p>Happy to share yet another publication with the Siri Speech team at Apple, this time led by Sashank Gondala, who interned with us last year. Our full paper<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.07219">Error-driven Pruning of Language Models for Virtual Assistants</a> is accepted at ICASSP 2021.</p>

<p>We focus on improving the effectiveness of a Virtual Assistant (VA) in recognizing emerging entities in spoken queries. We introduce a method that uses historical user interactions to forecast which entities will gain in popularity and become trending, and it subse- quently integrates the predictions within the Automated Speech Recognition (ASR) component of the VA. Experiments show that our proposed approach results in a 20% relative reduction in errors on emerging entity name utterances without degrading the overall recognition quality of the system.</p>
<p>Happy to share the news about my first joint pubication with the Siri Speech team at Apple. Our short paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.12816">Predicting Entity Popularity to Improve Spoken Entity Recognition by Virtual Assistants</a> with Christophe van Gysel, myself, Ernie Pusateri, and Ilya Oparin, is accepted at SIGIR 2020.</p>

<p>Modeling user browsing behavior is an active research area with
tangible real-world applications, e.g., organizations can adapt
their online presence to their visitors browsing behavior with
positive effects in user engagement, and revenue. We concentrate on
online news agents, and present a semi-supervised method for
predicting news articles that a user will visit after reading an
initial article. Our method tackles the problem using language
intent models trained on historical data which can cope
with unseen articles. We evaluate our method on a large set of
articles and in several experimental settings. Our results
demonstrate the utility of language intent models for predicting
user browsing behavior within online news sites.</p>

<p>I design scalable systems for speech, search, recommendation, and predictive analytics, combining theory with elegant engineering to enhance user experiences. With a Ph.D. in Machine Learning and a strong foundation in Physics, I have founded three companies: MyYard, the first cloud-based ERP system for the waste management industry; 904Labs, the world’s first self-learning product search engine offered as a service; and Solumbro, which introduced the first solar-powered umbrella with a virtual assistant. As an academic, my research has earned an H-index of 20, with over 55 published papers. I have co-supervised a Ph.D. thesis and guided more than 10 master’s theses. Currently, I’m an R&amp;D Engineer at Apple, tackling virtual assistants at the challenging intersection of speech and search.</p>

                <p>I got many questions after the talk which is a sign that the audience understood the topic and was intrigued by what A.I. can do for search. Some of the questions were brought to the following breaks with some of them leading to follow up meetings in the next days.</p>
<p>I much enjoyed the conference, and I hope that the organizers will follow up with another version next year. I believe that we do need more of this type of initiative to disseminate what A.I. is and A.I. can and cannot do so that organizations shape a better picture of how they can use it to solve challenges that they face.</p>
