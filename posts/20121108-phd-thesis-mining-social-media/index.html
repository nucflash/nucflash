<blockquote>
<p>The advent of social media has established a symbiotic relationship
between social media and online news. This relationship can be
leveraged for tracking news content, and predicting behavior with
tangible real-world applications, e.g., online reputation
management, ad pricing, news ranking, and media analysis. In this
thesis we focus on tracking news content in social media, and
predicting user behavior.</p>
<p>In the first part, we develop methods for tracking content which
build upon, and extend practices in Information Retrieval. We
begin with discovering social media posts that discuss a news
article yet they do not provide a hyperlink to it. Our methods model
news articles using several channels of information, either
endogenous or exogenous to the article. These models are then used
to query an index of social media posts. During this process we
found that the query models are close in size to the documents to be
retrieved, violating a standard assumption of language
modeling. We correct for this discrepancy by introducing two
hypergeometric language models for modeling both queries, and
documents to be retrieved.</p>
<p>In the second part, we focus on predicting behavior. First we look
at predicting listeners&rsquo; preference in spoken user generated
content, namely, podcasts. Then, we predict popularity of news
articles from several news agents in terms of the volume of comments
they receive. We develop models for predicting the popularity of an
article for both before and after it is published. Finally, we look
at a different aspect of news impact: how reading a news article
affects future user browsing behavior. In each setting, we find
patterns that characterize the underlying behavior and extract
features that we then use to establish models for predicting online
behavior.</p>

                <p>Much of what is discussed in social media is inspired by events in the news and, vice versa, social media provide us with a handle on the impact of news events. We address the following linking task: given a news article, find social media utterances that implicitly reference it. We follow a three-step approach: we derive multiple query models from a given source news article, which are then used to retrieve utterances from a target social media index, resulting in multiple ranked lists that we then merge using data fusion techniques. Query models are created by exploiting the structure of the source article and by using explicitly linked social media utterances that discuss the source article. To combat query drift resulting from the large volume of text, either in the source news article itself or in social media utterances explicitly linked to it, we introduce a graph-based method for selecting discriminative terms.

<p>Modeling user browsing behavior is an active research area with
tangible real-world applications, e.g., organizations can adapt
their online presence to their visitors browsing behavior with
positive effects in user engagement, and revenue. We concentrate on
online news agents, and present a semi-supervised method for
predicting news articles that a user will visit after reading an
initial article. Our method tackles the problem using language
intent models trained on historical data which can cope
with unseen articles. We evaluate our method on a large set of
articles and in several experimental settings. Our results
demonstrate the utility of language intent models for predicting
user browsing behavior within online news sites.</p>

                <p>Republished article finding is the task of identifying instances of articles that have been published in one source and republished more or less verbatim in another source, which is often a social media source. We address this task as an ad hoc retrieval problem, using the source article as a query. Our approach is based on language modeling. We revisit the assumptions underlying the unigram language model taking into account the fact that in our setup queries are as long as complete news articles. We argue that in this case, the underlying generative assumption of sampling words from a document with replacement, i.e., the multinomial modeling of documents, produces less accurate query likelihood estimates.

Our main preliminary conclusions are as follows. For the Blog track we find that for top stories identification a blogs to news approach outperforms a simple news to blogs approach. This is interesting, as this approach starts with no input except for a date, whereas the news to blogs approach also has news headlines as input. For the web track, we find that spam is an important issue in the ad hoc task and that Wikipedia- based heuristic optimization approaches help to boost the retrieval performance, which is assumed to potentially reduce the spam in top ranked documents. As for the diversity task, we explored different methods. Initial results show that clustering and a topic model-based approach have similar performance, which are relatively better than a query log based approach. Our performance in the Entity track was downright</p>

<p>We propose a retrieval model for searching microblog posts for a given topic of interest. We develop a language modeling approach tailored to microblogging characteristics, where redundancy-based IR methods cannot be used in a straightforward manner. We enhance this model with two groups of quality indicators: textual and microblog specific. Additionally, we propose a dynamic query expansion model for microblog post retrieval. Experimental results on Twitter data reveal the usefulness of boolean search, and demonstrate the utility of quality indicators and query expansion in microblog search.</p>

                <p>Recent years have witnessed a persistent interest in generating pseudo test collections, both for training and evaluation purposes. We describe a method for generating queries and relevance judgments for microblog search in an unsupervised way. Our starting point is this intuition: tweets with a hashtag are relevant to the topic covered by the hashtag and hence to a suitable query derived from the hashtag. Our baseline method selects all commonly used hashtags, and all associated tweets as relevance judgments; we then generate a query from these tweets. Next, we generate a timestamp for each query, allowing us to use temporal information in the training process. We then enrich the generation process with knowledge derived from an editorial test collection for microblog search.

<p>Offering access to information in microblog posts requires successful language identification. Language identification on sparse and noisy data can be challenging. In this paper we explore the performance of a state-of-the-art n-gram-based language identifier, and we introduce two semi-supervised priors to enhance performance at microblog post level: (i) blogger-basedprior, using previous posts by the same blogger, and (ii) link-based prior, using the pages linked to from the post. We test our models on five languages (Dutch, English, French, German, and Spanish), and a set of 1,000 tweets per language. Results show that our priors improve accuracy, but that there is still room for improvement.</p>
