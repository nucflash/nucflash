    <p>I was happy to be invited at the <a href="https://twitter.com/amsterdam_ai/status/940286324178915339">Amsterdam City A.I. Event on December 11, 2017</a>. My talk revolved around our experiences at 904Labs in building an A.I. focused company. It was fun to be among A.I. enthusiasts and to see that people identified with our experiences–which means that we are on good track!</p>
<p>The talk is <a href="https://youtu.be/imRVhX_412g?t=34m40s">online on YouTube</a> (clicking the link will start playing the video at the start of my talk):</p>

                <p>It was a packed room, with more than 200 registered people for the event, and the talk was broadcasted live on YouTube. There will soon be a video, which I will share here. The audience was from diverse backgrounds, and I enjoyed the interactions very much. I was happily surprised by the professional organization of the event, and the ambition for making Frankfurt one of the leading centres in data science in Europe. All the best to the organizers and I hope to see more collaboration on data science between Frankfurt and Amsterdam in the near future!</p>

                <p>Besides core business, it was nice to see other startups and non-startups from Amsterdam and catch up with old faces and meet new ones. Overall, it was a fun experience. A big thanks to the A.I. Expo Europe organizers for inviting us over!</p>

                <p>I got many questions after the talk which is a sign that the audience understood the topic and was intrigued by what A.I. can do for search. Some of the questions were brought to the following breaks with some of them leading to follow up meetings in the next days.</p>
<p>I much enjoyed the conference, and I hope that the organizers will follow up with another version next year. I believe that we do need more of this type of initiative to disseminate what A.I. is and A.I. can and cannot do so that organizations shape a better picture of how they can use it to solve challenges that they face.</p>

<p>Streamwatchr (2013–2016), developed at the University of Amsterdam, leveraged machine learning and named entity extraction to track global music listening behavior in real time through tweets. It offered features like Top-100 charts, interactive maps, and a “radio” stream mode driven by a dynamic recommender system. Using Python and MongoDB, it processed over 438 million tweets, identified 660,941 artists, and linked them to MusicBrainz and YouTube videos. This innovative blend of analytics and entity linking earned it a spot in the Dutch delegation at South by Southwest (SXSW).</p>
<p>Streamwatchr (2013&ndash;2016) was a web application developed at the University of Amsterdam, by Wouter Weerkamp, Maarten de Rijke, and myself. Streamwatchr monitored the Twitter feed for #nowplaying, and  tracked how people interacted with songs, artists, albums, in real-time. In its latest version it also identified which parts of the lyrics were the most sung along!</p>
