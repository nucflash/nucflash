    <p>I moved to Barcelona in the first week of September for a three-month internship at Yahoo! Research Labs. I’m very excited about it, and I&rsquo;m looking forward to getting to know the people here and the problems they are working on.</p>
<p>Update: My work at Yahoo! Research Labs resulted in a publication at SIGIR 2012; see <a href="../20120623-sigir2012-language-intent-models/">post</a>.</p>

<p>This summer I was happy to be back at the Special Interest Group in Information Retrieval (SIGIR), this time, in Pisa, Italy. Last time I was at SIGIR was in Portland back in 2012, where I was presenting the work I did at Yahoo! Barcelona. SIGIR is the top international conference on search engines, and it&rsquo;s always good fun to hear the latest developments and exchange new ideas.</p>

<p>I was happy to be invited at <a href="http://frankfurt-data-science.com">Frankfurt Data Science meetup</a> to talk about data science, meetups, and how to build a data science-oriented startup. The event was held at <a href="http://www.frankfurt-school.de/en/home">Frankfurt School</a> on <a href="https://www.meetup.com/FankfutDataScience/events/247415610/">March 1<sup>st</sup>, 2018</a>. In my talk I gave an overview of the meetup scene in Amsterdam, briefly presented <a href="http://amsterdamdatascience.nl">Amsterdam Data Science</a> and its activites, and then I shared my experiences on founding and developing <a href="http://904labs.com">904Labs</a>, before I delved into one of my favorite topics: machine learning and search.</p>

                <p>In my talk I touched upon a bunch of challenges we&rsquo;ve faced at 904Labs and how we came about to solving them. Open questions revolve around online learning to rank algorithms, delayed feedback, design of new metrics to avoid embarassing results, and the importance of investing in an evaluation platform. At 904Labs we have come a long way and we have working answers for these questions, however, as these questions are particularly difficult to answer, I&rsquo;ve invited people to drop me a note with ideas, if they are interested. I&rsquo;ve already got some nice feedback, and I hope to see more research on these areas in the near future!</p>
<p>Below are some tweets from my talk.</p>

                <p>Community engagement and academic collaboration have been pivotal, with active roles in conferences like SIGIR, WWW, and WSDM, among others. My Ph.D. thesis, Mining Social Media: Tracking Content and Predicting Behavior, delves into tracking news content in social media and modeling user behavior. This work, alongside my industry research, continues to shape my understanding and application of machine learning and information retrieval to solve real-world problems.</p>
<h3 id="research-interests">Research Interests</h3>
<p>I have worked on a wide spectrum of information access problems ranging from predictive analytics and content tracking to entity linking and online learning to rank. Most of  my research has been conducted during 2007–2014 at <a href="http://ilps.science.uva.nl/">Information and Language Processing Systems (ILPS)</a> at the University of Amsterdam and it continues today at Apple. In the table below, I list an overview of my research interests over the years:</p>

                <p>On 31 May, I was invited to give a talk at <a href="https://www.meetup.com/TECH-Talks-Meetup-Amsterdam/">TECH Talks in Amsterdam</a>. TECH Talks is a new meetup organized by <a href="https://techloop.io">Techloop.io</a>, a new way for matching jobs and talent in IT. My talk revolved on how we built an e-commerce focused search engine using machine learning (or as most people know it, A.I.). The meetup had a great start with more than 200 registered people and more than 100 people showed up; the room at TQ was at its maximum capacity! The audience was diverse with a nice mix of frontend, backend , senior and junior engineers, and also people from other disciplines who are interested in keeping up with latest developments in IT and e-commerce. Techloop and TQ were great organizers providing a great atmosphere (pizza and beer, included) facilitating great chats and networks afterwards.</p>

                <p>It was an intense two days, with lots of people dropping by 904Labs&rsquo; booth and asking about what we do and how 904Labs search technology can help them in their settings. Altough the average visitor profile was not looking for onsite search, we had good chats with a bunch of Dutch and international and small, medium, and big companies on how onsite search can help their endeavors. We talked on how search technology is underneath many applications, including chatbots, and self-service applications. No matter the application, good search can help increase revenue in the setting of selling products, or reduce costs in the setting of self-service as visitors are better able to find the information they&rsquo;re looking for without calling the company&rsquo;s call centre.</p>
