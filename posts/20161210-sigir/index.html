<p>This summer I was happy to be back at the Special Interest Group in Information Retrieval (SIGIR), this time, in Pisa, Italy. Last time I was at SIGIR was in Portland back in 2012, where I was presenting the work I did at Yahoo! Barcelona. SIGIR is the top international conference on search engines, and it&rsquo;s always good fun to hear the latest developments and exchange new ideas.</p>
<p>This year I talked at the industry track where I shared my experiences from running a search startup in the Netherlands. I received positive feedback, and it was good to catch up with old friends and meet new people. If you want a <a href="https://www.904labs.com/2016/08/05/904labs-sigir-2016/">short recap from the latest and greatest trends in search technology, read on my summary on 904Labs blog</a>.</p>

<p>European Conference on Information Retrieval (ECIR) is a annual European scientific conference around bhe topics of search engines, recommender systems, text analytics, user modeling, and evaluation. <a href="http://ecir2018.org">This year ECIR was held in Grenoble, France.</a> With more than 250 attendants and 4 days packed with tutorials, workshops, research, and industry talks, it was a great place to be to get updated with the latest and greatest about search engines.</p>
<p>The theme of this year&rsquo;s Industry Day was to bring lessons learned from industry to academia. What are differences when developing a research algorithm and when we bring to practice? These lessons could inspire and inform our fellow academics for the challenges practitioners face when bring these algorithms to production.</p>

                <p>I&rsquo;m happy to share some great results with regards to the utility of self-learning search and revenue on e-commerce sites. 904Labs self-learning search improves revenue by 36% when compared to a highly, but manually, tuned Apache Solr search engine. Good job 904Labs team!</p>

                <p>On 31 May, I was invited to give a talk at <a href="https://www.meetup.com/TECH-Talks-Meetup-Amsterdam/">TECH Talks in Amsterdam</a>. TECH Talks is a new meetup organized by <a href="https://techloop.io">Techloop.io</a>, a new way for matching jobs and talent in IT. My talk revolved on how we built an e-commerce focused search engine using machine learning (or as most people know it, A.I.). The meetup had a great start with more than 200 registered people and more than 100 people showed up; the room at TQ was at its maximum capacity! The audience was diverse with a nice mix of frontend, backend , senior and junior engineers, and also people from other disciplines who are interested in keeping up with latest developments in IT and e-commerce. Techloop and TQ were great organizers providing a great atmosphere (pizza and beer, included) facilitating great chats and networks afterwards.</p>
