    <p>I&rsquo;m very happy to share news on the latest success of <a href="https://904labs.com">904Labs A.I. for Search</a> with our new customer, <a href="https://eci.nl">eci.nl</a>.</p>
<p>eci is one of the largest online book specialists in the Netherlands and Belgium, with an estimated yearly revenue of 15m euro for the Dutch part. For their site search, eci relied on a manually optimized Apache Solr, integrated into Intershop.</p>
<p>During a three-week A/B test we&rsquo;ve shown a <em>38% improvement in revenue and a 34% increase in conversion rate</em> compared to the in-house Apache Solr search engine. This shows once more that adding A.I. to your search engine really makes a difference! <a href="https://www.904labs.com/en/eci-increases-revenue-substantially-with-ai-for-search">Read the full story here.</a></p>

<p>European Conference on Information Retrieval (ECIR) is a annual European scientific conference around bhe topics of search engines, recommender systems, text analytics, user modeling, and evaluation. <a href="http://ecir2018.org">This year ECIR was held in Grenoble, France.</a> With more than 250 attendants and 4 days packed with tutorials, workshops, research, and industry talks, it was a great place to be to get updated with the latest and greatest about search engines.</p>
<p>The theme of this year&rsquo;s Industry Day was to bring lessons learned from industry to academia. What are differences when developing a research algorithm and when we bring to practice? These lessons could inspire and inform our fellow academics for the challenges practitioners face when bring these algorithms to production.</p>

                <p>It was an intense two days, with lots of people dropping by 904Labs&rsquo; booth and asking about what we do and how 904Labs search technology can help them in their settings. Altough the average visitor profile was not looking for onsite search, we had good chats with a bunch of Dutch and international and small, medium, and big companies on how onsite search can help their endeavors. We talked on how search technology is underneath many applications, including chatbots, and self-service applications. No matter the application, good search can help increase revenue in the setting of selling products, or reduce costs in the setting of self-service as visitors are better able to find the information they&rsquo;re looking for without calling the company&rsquo;s call centre.</p>

                <p>I&rsquo;m happy to share some great results with regards to the utility of self-learning search and revenue on e-commerce sites. 904Labs self-learning search improves revenue by 36% when compared to a highly, but manually, tuned Apache Solr search engine. Good job 904Labs team!</p>

                <p>The Dutch-Belgian Information Retrieval Workshop was held this year in Delft. A nice lot of people from all around the Netherlands, Belgium, and a handful from abroad came together to share their research highlights from this year. It was a nice programme, filled with interesting short talks (about 15mins) that were great to give us a summary of what everybody is working on.</p>
<p>My personal highlight was Chato&rsquo;s keynote speech on algorithmic bias. Although a lot is discussed on the topic, there is yet no to little work that presents some sort of foundation that describes the issue, frames it and offers some theoretical framework from which we can start thinking about solutions. Chato&rsquo;s work laid the ground works on this area. He started with explaining what algorithmic bias is and stressed how coupled it is with data collection. I&rsquo;m looking forward to seeing more on his work on the subject.</p>

My talk revolved around our experiences at 904Labs in building an A.I. focused company. It was fun to be among A.I. enthusiasts and to see that people identified with our experiences–which means that we are on good track!</p>
