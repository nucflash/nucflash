<p>We focus on improving the effectiveness of a Virtual Assistant (VA) in recognizing emerging entities in spoken queries. We introduce a method that uses historical user interactions to forecast which entities will gain in popularity and become trending, and it subse- quently integrates the predictions within the Automated Speech Recognition (ASR) component of the VA. Experiments show that our proposed approach results in a 20% relative reduction in errors on emerging entity name utterances without degrading the overall recognition quality of the system.</p>
<p>Happy to share the news about my first joint pubication with the Siri Speech team at Apple. Our short paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.12816">Predicting Entity Popularity to Improve Spoken Entity Recognition by Virtual Assistants</a> with Christophe van Gysel, myself, Ernie Pusateri, and Ilya Oparin, is accepted at SIGIR 2020.</p>

<p>Language models (LMs) for virtual assistants (VAs) are typically trained on large amounts of data, resulting in prohibitively large models which require excessive memory and/or cannot be used to serve user requests in real-time. Entropy pruning results in smaller models but with significant degradation of effectiveness in the tail of the user request distribution. We customize entropy pruning by allowing for a keep list of infrequent n-grams that require a more relaxed pruning threshold, and propose three methods to construct the keep list. Each method has its own advantages and disadvantages with respect to LM size, ASR accuracy and cost of constructing the keep list. Our best LM gives 8% average Word Error Rate (WER) reduction on a targeted test set, but is 3 times larger than the baseline. We also propose discriminative methods to reduce the size of the LM while retaining the majority of the WER gains achieved by the largest LM.</p>

<p>Modeling user browsing behavior is an active research area with
tangible real-world applications, e.g., organizations can adapt
their online presence to their visitors browsing behavior with
positive effects in user engagement, and revenue. We concentrate on
online news agents, and present a semi-supervised method for
predicting news articles that a user will visit after reading an
initial article. Our method tackles the problem using language
intent models trained on historical data which can cope
with unseen articles. We evaluate our method on a large set of
articles and in several experimental settings. Our results
demonstrate the utility of language intent models for predicting
user browsing behavior within online news sites.</p>

<p>In the second part, we focus on predicting behavior. First we look
at predicting listeners&rsquo; preference in spoken user generated
content, namely, podcasts. Then, we predict popularity of news
articles from several news agents in terms of the volume of comments
they receive. We develop models for predicting the popularity of an
article for both before and after it is published. Finally, we look
at a different aspect of news impact: how reading a news article
affects future user browsing behavior. In each setting, we find
patterns that characterize the underlying behavior and extract
features that we then use to establish models for predicting online
behavior.</p>

<p>People refer to products in different ways that products are described in the catalogue. Neural networks, learning to rank, query intent engines are all important. Our experience at <a href="https://904labs.com">904Labs</a> shown that a query intent engine that boosts specific product categories given a query, boosts our learning to rank system by more than 16% in additional revenue. These results suggest that effective initial ranking is very important for effective learning to rank. To this end, we foresee an increasing interest in methods that can re-rank the entire collection and not only the top-N documents. This is particularly important for larger shops with large inventories (more than hundred of thousands of items) where a query can return hundreds of items, and only the top few are re-ranked.</p>

                <p>Part of the Artificial Intelligence Masters programme in which I used to teach was one month hands-on project. I have supervised Andrei Oghina and Mathias Breuss on whether <em>can we predict a movie&rsquo;s IMDB rating from social media before the movie is out</em>. Andrei and Mathias collected tweets about movies and their respective YouTube trailers, and they extracted several features which were used for training a rating classifier. We have found out that we are able predict a movie&rsquo;s IMDB rating with ±0.25 accuracy. That is if a movie gets an average IMDB rating of 8, we would predict 7.75 or 8.25. This is quite impressive for predicting a movie&rsquo;s success before it is even released.</p>
