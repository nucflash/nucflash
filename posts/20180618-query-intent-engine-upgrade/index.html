<p>Today at <a href="https://904labs.com">904Labs Search</a> we&rsquo;ve been having fun with the next version of our Query Intent engine.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t know what a Query Intent engine is, here&rsquo;s <a href="../20170618-query-intent-engine/">some background</a>; otherwise keep reading.</p>
<p>Our Query Intent engine is closing to one year old, and it&rsquo;s pretty cool: it can quickly boostrap a knowledge graph and continuously update it straight from our customer&rsquo;s data. Since its introduction in September 2017, it has been tested in many different domains and languages and has shown substantial revenue uplift across customers.</p>
<p>In the last couple of weeks, our team has been busy tweaking our engine and pushing it even further. Our Query Intent engine was doing already a good job, mapping query free text to product attributes such as category, or brands. However, we&rsquo;ve never tested going deeper into particular product attributes, such the product weight or even, wattage. Our engineers managed to extend the logic and the scalability of the algorithm to support very fine grained suggestions, if such fine-grained information exists in the index. It is quite a feat and I&rsquo;m very proud of our team!</p>
<p>On top of the engineering feat, the algorithm itself is pretty lean and has quite a few distinctive features that are hard to find in other engines: it does not depend on external dependencies (read Wikipedia), nor it needs periodic re-training. The only thing that a customer has to do is to plug in our system to a Apache Solr/Elasticsearch, and 904Labs Query Intent engine is built incrementally, one click/add-to-basket/purchase at a time. Oh, and it doesn&rsquo;t write anything on your index. Magic!</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a few interesting examples that came out from today&rsquo;s experimentation:</p>
<p>(the examples are in Dutch; I try to translate the queries into English. Field attributes and values may be partially redacted for anonymity)</p>
<h2 id="some-relatively-simple-cases">Some relatively simple cases<a class="headerlink" href="#some-relatively-simple-cases" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The system learns to map the query: <code>lampen</code> (lamps) to Solr&rsquo;s directive: <code>category:Lampen</code>. Learning of this mapping is automatic and based on only from user interactions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Query: <code>Tent</code> → <code>category:Tenten</code>. Note how the system has learned the mapping from singular to plural without using of manual synonyms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Query: <code>Stoel kussens</code> (chair pillows) → <code>category:Kussens</code> (pillows). In this example, the system maps a specific query to a broader category. This highlights a productive synergy between human and machine: the site’s taxonomy lacked a dedicated leaf node for chair pillows, so the system intelligently selected the closest broader category. This choice influences the downstream learning-to-rank process, bringing greater focus to the broader category of pillows.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="some-more-difficult-cases">Some more difficult cases<a class="headerlink" href="#some-more-difficult-cases" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Query: <code>Bed 160x200</code> → <code>size:160x200 cm</code> and <code>size:160 x 200 cm</code>. Note how the system has learned the discrepency in attribute values and suggests both; in the first one there are no spaces in the representation of the dimension, in the second one there are.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Query: <code>stoelen</code> (chairs) → <code>category:... en eetkamerstoelen</code> (kitchens and dining chairs). Here the system attempts to infer the intented category for a broad query such as &ldquo;chairs&rdquo;. Although there is a category labeled &ldquo;chairs&rdquo;, the system decides to suggest a particular leaf within the taxonomy branch of chairs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Query: <code>tuinset</code> (garden set) → <code>number_of_persons:12</code>. The system implicitly defines the size and dimensions of the garden set from historical user behavior. Given the lack of a user profile, suggestions like this aim at capturing the interests of the average user of the shop.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="some-very-difficult-cases">Some very difficult cases<a class="headerlink" href="#some-very-difficult-cases" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Finally, two of my favorites, where the system attempts to infer several attributes of products from broad queries—</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Query: <code>prieel</code> (garden house) → <code>material:XXX, color:Beige, weight:4.9 kg</code>. Here the system maps a broad query to distinct set of attributes, i.e., the material, the color, and even the weight of the garden house. Again, with no user profile provided, these suggestions attempt to capture the interests of the average user of the shop.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Query: <code>eenpersoons bed</code> (one person bed) → <code>size:90 x 200 cm</code>. The system maps the query to exact dimensions for the bed!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Query: <code>XXX lounge</code> (brand redacted) → <code>model:White XXX</code>. Here the system manages to map a brand and type of products from this brand to a specific product model from this brand. Again, without user profiling. Quite impressive!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope you also find exciting what the new version of 904Labs Query Intent engine can do. You can have this technology working for you too and straight away, by <a href="mailto:info@904labs.com?subject=I like your Query Intent examples, and I want to have it too. Please get in touch."><del>getting in touch with us</del></a>. Plus, unlike other search engine providers, with us you keep your index, and we don&rsquo;t touch it so we don&rsquo;t lock you in. The first month is for free, terminable monthly.</p>

                <p>At 904Labs we&rsquo;ve developed a query intent engine that hooks up on an e-shop&rsquo;s data, bootstraps a knowledge graph, and it learns the mapping to directives automatically, i.e.,  without supervision (read without human annotations). It doesn&rsquo;t require retraining nor external dependencies, and you can use it straight away, today, on your own Apache Solr or Elasticsearch index (from which we only read and never write and we never lock you in).

<p>People refer to products in different ways that products are described in the catalogue. Neural networks, learning to rank, query intent engines are all important. Our experience at <a href="https://904labs.com">904Labs</a> shown that a query intent engine that boosts specific product categories given a query, boosts our learning to rank system by more than 16% in additional revenue. These results suggest that effective initial ranking is very important for effective learning to rank. To this end, we foresee an increasing interest in methods that can re-rank the entire collection and not only the top-N documents. This is particularly important for larger shops with large inventories (more than hundred of thousands of items) where a query can return hundreds of items, and only the top few are re-ranked.</p>

                <p>In our talk, I described the importance of search in e-commerce by giving examples of failed searches in a number of settings, from finding advertized items using onsite search to mobile search. I followed by with why people choose Amazon to start their product search and highlighted that 54% of them choose Amazon because of their great search functionality–that is the reason number five for people to go to Amazon. Then, I explained why optimizing the ranking manually is close to impossible for humans by laying out the insane amount of options available and enumerating the search space (which can be at millions of millions of choices). With this as foundation, I talked about machine learning and the particular type of machine learning that we use at 904Labs for optimizing search rankings in real-time. I followed up with describing our query intent engine, which is powered by 904Sense, and our automatic synonym extraction engine. In my conclusions, I re-iterated that A.I. for Search</p>
