<p><a href="http://ai2future.com">AI2Future</a> is a local, Croatian, initiative for disseminating the importance and for grounding the use of Artificial Intelligence. The conference brings together researchers, A.I. start ups, and large corporates from all around Croatia to share experiences and learn from each other on what A.I. can and cannot do.</p>
<p>I was invited to give one of the two keynote talks. The first keynote focused on conversational agents and natural language processing and mine followed up with insights how search powers a large spectrum of applications from search, question and answering, and recommendations. I focused on the work we do at 904Labs and illustrated the principles of online learning to rank through real-world examples from our experimences with our customers.</p>
<p>I got many questions after the talk which is a sign that the audience understood the topic and was intrigued by what A.I. can do for search. Some of the questions were brought to the following breaks with some of them leading to follow up meetings in the next days.</p>
<p>I much enjoyed the conference, and I hope that the organizers will follow up with another version next year. I believe that we do need more of this type of initiative to disseminate what A.I. is and A.I. can and cannot do so that organizations shape a better picture of how they can use it to solve challenges that they face.</p>

                <p>On 31 May, I was invited to give a talk at <a href="https://www.meetup.com/TECH-Talks-Meetup-Amsterdam/">TECH Talks in Amsterdam</a>. TECH Talks is a new meetup organized by <a href="https://techloop.io">Techloop.io</a>, a new way for matching jobs and talent in IT. My talk revolved on how we built an e-commerce focused search engine using machine learning (or as most people know it, A.I.). The meetup had a great start with more than 200 registered people and more than 100 people showed up; the room at TQ was at its maximum capacity! The audience was diverse with a nice mix of frontend, backend , senior and junior engineers, and also people from other disciplines who are interested in keeping up with latest developments in IT and e-commerce. Techloop and TQ were great organizers providing a great atmosphere (pizza and beer, included) facilitating great chats and networks afterwards.</p>

<p>European Conference on Information Retrieval (ECIR) is a annual European scientific conference around bhe topics of search engines, recommender systems, text analytics, user modeling, and evaluation. <a href="http://ecir2018.org">This year ECIR was held in Grenoble, France.</a> With more than 250 attendants and 4 days packed with tutorials, workshops, research, and industry talks, it was a great place to be to get updated with the latest and greatest about search engines.</p>
<p>The theme of this year&rsquo;s Industry Day was to bring lessons learned from industry to academia. What are differences when developing a research algorithm and when we bring to practice? These lessons could inspire and inform our fellow academics for the challenges practitioners face when bring these algorithms to production.</p>

<p>This year we were invited to be part of A.I. Expo Europe, held in Amsterdam. The organizers were very kind to offer us a free booth in the Startup zone of the exhibition. The event took place on 27 and 28 June 2018, and it was packed with talks and visitors. There were three tracks: A.I., IoT, and Blockchain, with the latter two dominating the exhibitors list.</p>

<p>I design scalable systems for speech, search, recommendation, and predictive analytics, combining theory with elegant engineering to enhance user experiences. With a Ph.D. in Machine Learning and a strong foundation in Physics, I have founded three companies: MyYard, the first cloud-based ERP system for the waste management industry; 904Labs, the world’s first self-learning product search engine offered as a service; and Solumbro, which introduced the first solar-powered umbrella with a virtual assistant. As an academic, my research has earned an H-index of 20, with over 55 published papers. I have co-supervised a Ph.D. thesis and guided more than 10 master’s theses. Currently, I’m an R&amp;D Engineer at Apple, tackling virtual assistants at the challenging intersection of speech and search.</p>
