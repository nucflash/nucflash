<p>Modeling user browsing behavior is an active research area with
tangible real-world applications, e.g., organizations can adapt
their online presence to their visitors browsing behavior with
positive effects in user engagement, and revenue. We concentrate on
online news agents, and present a semi-supervised method for
predicting news articles that a user will visit after reading an
initial article. Our method tackles the problem using language
intent models trained on historical data which can cope
with unseen articles. We evaluate our method on a large set of
articles and in several experimental settings. Our results
demonstrate the utility of language intent models for predicting
user browsing behavior within online news sites.</p>
<p>I am very happy that our paper <em>Language Intent Models for Inferring User Browsing Behavior</em> by Manos Tsagkias, and Roi Blanco [<a href="#1">1</a>] has been accepted at SIGIR 2013, which will be held in Portland, Oregon, 12–16 August 2012. The paper was realized during my <a href="../20110914-yahoo-research/">three-month internship at Yahoo! Research Barcelona during September–December 2011</a>.</p>

<p>In the second part, we focus on predicting behavior. First we look
at predicting listeners&rsquo; preference in spoken user generated
content, namely, podcasts. Then, we predict popularity of news
articles from several news agents in terms of the volume of comments
they receive. We develop models for predicting the popularity of an
article for both before and after it is published. Finally, we look
at a different aspect of news impact: how reading a news article
affects future user browsing behavior. In each setting, we find
patterns that characterize the underlying behavior and extract
features that we then use to establish models for predicting online
behavior.</p>

<p>On-line news agents provide commenting facilities for readers to express their views with regard to news stories. The number of user supplied comments on a news article may be indicative of its importance or impact. We report on exploratory work that predicts the comment volume of news articles prior to publication using five feature sets. We address the prediction task as a two stage classification task: a binary classification identifies articles with the potential to receive comments, and a second binary classification receives the output from the first step to label articles &ldquo;low&rdquo; or &ldquo;high&rdquo; comment volume. The results show solid performance for the former task, while performance degrades for the latter.</p>

                <p>Much of what is discussed in social media is inspired by events in the news and, vice versa, social media provide us with a handle on the impact of news events. We address the following linking task: given a news article, find social media utterances that implicitly reference it. We follow a three-step approach: we derive multiple query models from a given source news article, which are then used to retrieve utterances from a target social media index, resulting in multiple ranked lists that we then merge using data fusion techniques. Query models are created by exploiting the structure of the source article and by using explicitly linked social media utterances that discuss the source article. To combat query drift resulting from the large volume of text, either in the source news article itself or in social media utterances explicitly linked to it, we introduce a graph-based method for selecting discriminative terms.

<p>In this paper we describe how Twitter is used in various languages.
We observe notable differences between languages regarding the
use of hashtags, links, mentions, and conversations. We propose
two dimensions that can be used to classify languages, each of
which is likely to require different ways of analysis.</p>

<p>Podcasts display an unevenness characteristic of domains dominated by user generated content, resulting in potentially radical variation of the user preference they enjoy. We report on work that uses easily extractable surface features of podcasts in order to achieve solid performance on two podcast preference prediction tasks: classification of preferred vs. non-preferred podcasts and ranking podcasts by level of preference. We identify features with good discriminative potential by carrying out manual data analysis, resulting in a refinement of the indicators of an existent podcast preference framework. Our preference prediction is useful for topic-independent ranking of podcasts, and can be used to support download suggestion or collection browsing.</p>

                <p>Researchers and practitioners have been working on this problem for quite some time and progress has been made; however the community has still some way to go before solving it. At the core of current solutions, there is a lot of complex technology such as neural networks that power NLP (Natural Language Processing) tools and other pipelines that require lots of human annotations (read expensive). These approaches yield relatively good accuracy, however, putting these systems into production may still be a challenging engineering problem–from setting up the data pipelining to scaling up, to retraining, and to monitoring system effectiveness and efficiency.</p>
