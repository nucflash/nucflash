<blockquote>
<p>The advent of social media has established a symbiotic relationship
between social media and online news. This relationship can be
leveraged for tracking news content, and predicting behavior with
tangible real-world applications, e.g., online reputation
management, ad pricing, news ranking, and media analysis. In this
thesis we focus on tracking news content in social media, and
predicting user behavior.</p>
<p>In the first part, we develop methods for tracking content which
build upon, and extend practices in Information Retrieval. We
begin with discovering social media posts that discuss a news
article yet they do not provide a hyperlink to it. Our methods model
news articles using several channels of information, either
endogenous or exogenous to the article. These models are then used
to query an index of social media posts. During this process we
found that the query models are close in size to the documents to be
retrieved, violating a standard assumption of language
modeling. We correct for this discrepancy by introducing two
hypergeometric language models for modeling both queries, and
documents to be retrieved.</p>
<p>In the second part, we focus on predicting behavior. First we look
at predicting listeners&rsquo; preference in spoken user generated
content, namely, podcasts. Then, we predict popularity of news
articles from several news agents in terms of the volume of comments
they receive. We develop models for predicting the popularity of an
article for both before and after it is published. Finally, we look
at a different aspect of news impact: how reading a news article
affects future user browsing behavior. In each setting, we find
patterns that characterize the underlying behavior and extract
features that we then use to establish models for predicting online
behavior.</p>

                <p>Much of what is discussed in social media is inspired by events in the news and, vice versa, social media provide us with a handle on the impact of news events. We address the following linking task: given a news article, find social media utterances that implicitly reference it. We follow a three-step approach: we derive multiple query models from a given source news article, which are then used to retrieve utterances from a target social media index, resulting in multiple ranked lists that we then merge using data fusion techniques. Query models are created by exploiting the structure of the source article and by using explicitly linked social media utterances that discuss the source article. To combat query drift resulting from the large volume of text, either in the source news article itself or in social media utterances explicitly linked to it, we introduce a graph-based method for selecting discriminative terms.

<p>Modeling user browsing behavior is an active research area with
tangible real-world applications, e.g., organizations can adapt
their online presence to their visitors browsing behavior with
positive effects in user engagement, and revenue. We concentrate on
online news agents, and present a semi-supervised method for
predicting news articles that a user will visit after reading an
initial article. Our method tackles the problem using language
intent models trained on historical data which can cope
with unseen articles. We evaluate our method on a large set of
articles and in several experimental settings. Our results
demonstrate the utility of language intent models for predicting
user browsing behavior within online news sites.</p>

<p>We predict IMDb movie ratings and consider two sets of features: surface and textual features. For the latter, we assume that no social media signal is isolated and use data from multiple channels that are linked to a particular movie, such as tweets from Twitter and comments from YouTube. We extract textual features from each channel to use in our prediction model and we explore whether data from either of these channels can help to extract a better set of textual feature for prediction. Our best performing model is able to rate movies very close to the observed values.</p>

<p>With the rapid adoption of online shopping, academic research in the eCommerce domain has gained traction. However, significant research challenges remain, spanning from classic eCommerce search problems such as matching textual queries to multi-modal documents and ranking optimization for two-sided marketplaces to human-computer interaction and recom- mender systems for discovery and browsing. These research areas are important for under- standing customer behavior, driving engagement, and improving product discoverability and conversion. In this article we identify the challenges and highlight research opportunities to improve the eCommerce customer experience.</p>

<p>We propose a retrieval model for searching microblog posts for a given topic of interest. We develop a language modeling approach tailored to microblogging characteristics, where redundancy-based IR methods cannot be used in a straightforward manner. We enhance this model with two groups of quality indicators: textual and microblog specific. Additionally, we propose a dynamic query expansion model for microblog post retrieval. Experimental results on Twitter data reveal the usefulness of boolean search, and demonstrate the utility of quality indicators and query expansion in microblog search.</p>
