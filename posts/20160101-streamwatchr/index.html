<p>Streamwatchr (2013–2016), developed at the University of Amsterdam, leveraged machine learning and named entity extraction to track global music listening behavior in real time through tweets. It offered features like Top-100 charts, interactive maps, and a “radio” stream mode driven by a dynamic recommender system. Using Python and MongoDB, it processed over 438 million tweets, identified 660,941 artists, and linked them to MusicBrainz and YouTube videos. This innovative blend of analytics and entity linking earned it a spot in the Dutch delegation at South by Southwest (SXSW).</p>
<p>Streamwatchr (2013&ndash;2016) was a web application developed at the University of Amsterdam, by Wouter Weerkamp, Maarten de Rijke, and myself. Streamwatchr monitored the Twitter feed for #nowplaying, and  tracked how people interacted with songs, artists, albums, in real-time. In its latest version it also identified which parts of the lyrics were the most sung along!</p>
<p>Streamwatchr’s innovative approach earned it a place in the Dutch delegation for innovation at the internationally renowned South by Southwest (SXSW) festival.</p>

<p>Streamwatchr provided unique insights into global music listening behavior through features such as Top-100 charts, interactive maps, and a “radio” stream mode. The radio stream played a sequence of YouTube videos, with each song following the next based on the probability of them being played together. This was achieved by linking identified songs to YouTube videos and generating playlists driven by a recommender system. Behind the scenes, the system utilized a directed graph, where nodes represented songs, and edge weights encoded the likelihood of transitioning from one song to another. These weights were dynamically updated with every incoming tweet.</p>
<p>The engineering behind Streamwatchr was equally groundbreaking [<a href="#1">1</a>]. It collected music-related tweets in real time, extracted song and artist information, and mapped them to MusicBrainz, a comprehensive music database, and corresponding YouTube video clips. Every aspect of Streamwatchr, from popularity charts and trending music to song recommendations and analytics, was refreshed with each new tweet, ensuring a dynamic and up-to-date user experience.</p>
<p>Streamwatchr leveraged a tech stack of Python and MongoDB for analytics and recommendations. Its real-time capabilities were powered by efficient data structures and algorithms that minimized the computational overhead required for updates, delivering a seamless and responsive experience.</p>
<p>The millions of tweets and the hundreds of thousands of artists that Streamwatchr has listened to over the years have been distilled to a handful of noteworthy factoids:</p>

SIGIR is the top international conference on search engines, and it&rsquo;s always good fun to hear the latest developments and exchange new ideas.</p>

                <p>The Dutch-Belgian Information Retrieval Workshop was held this year in Delft. A nice lot of people from all around the Netherlands, Belgium, and a handful from abroad came together to share their research highlights from this year. It was a nice programme, filled with interesting short talks (about 15mins) that were great to give us a summary of what everybody is working on.</p>

                <p>It’s been an invaluable experience. 904Labs gifted us the knowledge of what it takes to build a product in the real-world, which is very different from what we had in mind when we left Academia. By now we know that a product needs to be fun from a tech/scientific perspective but it is equally important to satisfy customers needs and solve specific problems–at the same time it is bound by limited resources, either be it time, people, or budget. Finding the right balance on all three dimensions</p>
