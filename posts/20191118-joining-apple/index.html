    <p>Today marks my first day at Apple! I’ve joined the Apple Speech Recognition team within Siri, part of the AI/ML (Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning) organization. After 12 wonderful years in Amsterdam, I’ve relocated to Cupertino, California, in the United States. I’m thrilled to be working at Apple Park, one of the most iconic and beautiful buildings in the world. Excited for the journey ahead!</p>

<p><a href="http://ai2future.com">AI2Future</a> is a local, Croatian, initiative for disseminating the importance and for grounding the use of Artificial Intelligence. The conference brings together researchers, A.I. start ups, and large corporates from all around Croatia to share experiences and learn from each other on what A.I. can and cannot do.</p>
<p>I was invited to give one of the two keynote talks. The first keynote focused on conversational agents and natural language processing and mine followed up with insights how search powers a large spectrum of applications from search, question and answering, and recommendations. I focused on the work we do at 904Labs and illustrated the principles of online learning to rank through real-world examples from our experimences with our customers.</p>

<p>This summer I was happy to be back at the Special Interest Group in Information Retrieval (SIGIR), this time, in Pisa, Italy. Last time I was at SIGIR was in Portland back in 2012, where I was presenting the work I did at Yahoo! Barcelona. SIGIR is the top international conference on search engines, and it&rsquo;s always good fun to hear the latest developments and exchange new ideas.</p>

<p>I was happy to be invited at <a href="http://frankfurt-data-science.com">Frankfurt Data Science meetup</a> to talk about data science, meetups, and how to build a data science-oriented startup. The event was held at <a href="http://www.frankfurt-school.de/en/home">Frankfurt School</a> on <a href="https://www.meetup.com/FankfutDataScience/events/247415610/">March 1<sup>st</sup>, 2018</a>. In my talk I gave an overview of the meetup scene in Amsterdam, briefly presented <a href="http://amsterdamdatascience.nl">Amsterdam Data Science</a> and its activites, and then I shared my experiences on founding and developing <a href="http://904labs.com">904Labs</a>, before I delved into one of my favorite topics: machine learning and search.</p>

                <p>On 31 May, I was invited to give a talk at <a href="https://www.meetup.com/TECH-Talks-Meetup-Amsterdam/">TECH Talks in Amsterdam</a>. TECH Talks is a new meetup organized by <a href="https://techloop.io">Techloop.io</a>, a new way for matching jobs and talent in IT. My talk revolved on how we built an e-commerce focused search engine using machine learning (or as most people know it, A.I.). The meetup had a great start with more than 200 registered people and more than 100 people showed up; the room at TQ was at its maximum capacity! The audience was diverse with a nice mix of frontend, backend , senior and junior engineers, and also people from other disciplines who are interested in keeping up with latest developments in IT and e-commerce. Techloop and TQ were great organizers providing a great atmosphere (pizza and beer, included) facilitating great chats and networks afterwards.</p>
<p>You can see the video of the talks here (mine is the first after the introduction by Techloop):</p>
