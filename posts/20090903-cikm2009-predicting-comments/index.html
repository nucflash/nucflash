<p>On-line news agents provide commenting facilities for readers to express their views with regard to news stories. The number of user supplied comments on a news article may be indicative of its importance or impact. We report on exploratory work that predicts the comment volume of news articles prior to publication using five feature sets. We address the prediction task as a two stage classification task: a binary classification identifies articles with the potential to receive comments, and a second binary classification receives the output from the first step to label articles &ldquo;low&rdquo; or &ldquo;high&rdquo; comment volume. The results show solid performance for the former task, while performance degrades for the latter.</p>

                <p>We describe the participation of the University of Amsterdam’s ILPS group in the web, blog, web, entity, and relevance feedback track at TREC 2009. Our main preliminary conclusions are as follows. For the Blog track we find that for top stories identification a blogs to news approach outperforms a simple news to blogs approach. This is interesting, as this approach starts with no input except for a date, whereas the news to blogs approach also has news headlines as input. For the web track, we find that spam is an important issue in the ad hoc task and that Wikipedia- based heuristic optimization approaches help to boost the retrieval performance, which is assumed to potentially reduce the spam in top ranked documents. As for the diversity task, we explored different methods. Initial results show that clustering and a topic model-based approach have similar performance, which are relatively better than a query log based approach. Our performance in the Entity track was downright</p>

<p>The advent of social media has established a symbiotic relationship
between social media and online news. This relationship can be
leveraged for tracking news content, and predicting behavior with
tangible real-world applications, e.g., online reputation
management, ad pricing, news ranking, and media analysis. In this
thesis we focus on tracking news content in social media, and
predicting user behavior.</p>
<p>In the first part, we develop methods for tracking content which
build upon, and extend practices in Information Retrieval. We
begin with discovering social media posts that discuss a news
article yet they do not provide a hyperlink to it. Our methods model
news articles using several channels of information, either
endogenous or exogenous to the article. These models are then used
to query an index of social media posts. During this process we
found that the query models are close in size to the documents to be
retrieved, violating a standard assumption of language</p>

<p>Modeling user browsing behavior is an active research area with
tangible real-world applications, e.g., organizations can adapt
their online presence to their visitors browsing behavior with
positive effects in user engagement, and revenue. We concentrate on
online news agents, and present a semi-supervised method for
predicting news articles that a user will visit after reading an
initial article. Our method tackles the problem using language
intent models trained on historical data which can cope
with unseen articles. We evaluate our method on a large set of
articles and in several experimental settings. Our results
demonstrate the utility of language intent models for predicting
user browsing behavior within online news sites.</p>

<p>Offering access to information in microblog posts requires successful language identification. Language identification on sparse and noisy data can be challenging. In this paper we explore the performance of a state-of-the-art n-gram-based language identifier, and we introduce two semi-supervised priors to enhance performance at microblog post level: (i) blogger-basedprior, using previous posts by the same blogger, and (ii) link-based prior, using the pages linked to from the post. We test our models on five languages (Dutch, English, French, German, and Spanish), and a set of 1,000 tweets per language. Results show that our priors improve accuracy, but that there is still room for improvement.</p>

                <p>Republished article finding is the task of identifying instances of articles that have been published in one source and republished more or less verbatim in another source, which is often a social media source. We address this task as an ad hoc retrieval problem, using the source article as a query. Our approach is based on language modeling. We revisit the assumptions underlying the unigram language model taking into account the fact that in our setup queries are as long as complete news articles. We argue that in this case, the underlying generative assumption of sampling words from a document with replacement, i.e., the multinomial modeling of documents, produces less accurate query likelihood estimates.
