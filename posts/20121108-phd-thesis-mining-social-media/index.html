<blockquote>
<p>The advent of social media has established a symbiotic relationship
between social media and online news. This relationship can be
leveraged for tracking news content, and predicting behavior with
tangible real-world applications, e.g., online reputation
management, ad pricing, news ranking, and media analysis. In this
thesis we focus on tracking news content in social media, and
predicting user behavior.</p>
<p>In the first part, we develop methods for tracking content which
build upon, and extend practices in Information Retrieval. We
begin with discovering social media posts that discuss a news
article yet they do not provide a hyperlink to it. Our methods model
news articles using several channels of information, either
endogenous or exogenous to the article. These models are then used
to query an index of social media posts. During this process we
found that the query models are close in size to the documents to be
retrieved, violating a standard assumption of language
modeling. We correct for this discrepancy by introducing two
hypergeometric language models for modeling both queries, and
documents to be retrieved.</p>
<p>In the second part, we focus on predicting behavior. First we look
at predicting listeners&rsquo; preference in spoken user generated
content, namely, podcasts. Then, we predict popularity of news
articles from several news agents in terms of the volume of comments
they receive. We develop models for predicting the popularity of an
article for both before and after it is published. Finally, we look
at a different aspect of news impact: how reading a news article
affects future user browsing behavior. In each setting, we find
patterns that characterize the underlying behavior and extract
features that we then use to establish models for predicting online
behavior.</p>

<p>Modeling user browsing behavior is an active research area with
tangible real-world applications, e.g., organizations can adapt
their online presence to their visitors browsing behavior with
positive effects in user engagement, and revenue. We concentrate on
online news agents, and present a semi-supervised method for
predicting news articles that a user will visit after reading an
initial article. Our method tackles the problem using language
intent models trained on historical data which can cope
with unseen articles. We evaluate our method on a large set of
articles and in several experimental settings. Our results
demonstrate the utility of language intent models for predicting
user browsing behavior within online news sites.</p>

<p>We predict IMDb movie ratings and consider two sets of features: surface and textual features. For the latter, we assume that no social media signal is isolated and use data from multiple channels that are linked to a particular movie, such as tweets from Twitter and comments from YouTube. We extract textual features from each channel to use in our prediction model and we explore whether data from either of these channels can help to extract a better set of textual feature for prediction. Our best performing model is able to rate movies very close to the observed values.</p>

<p>With the rapid adoption of online shopping, academic research in the eCommerce domain has gained traction. However, significant research challenges remain, spanning from classic eCommerce search problems such as matching textual queries to multi-modal documents and ranking optimization for two-sided marketplaces to human-computer interaction and recom- mender systems for discovery and browsing. These research areas are important for under- standing customer behavior, driving engagement, and improving product discoverability and conversion. In this article we identify the challenges and highlight research opportunities to improve the eCommerce customer experience.</p>

                <p>A natural way is to devise a hybrid system of search and recommendations: We fire the query to a search system and then we take the first few items as seed to a recommender system for getting similar items. Or a system that transforms a query to an image (think AttnGAN or similar) and each product to an image and then rank documents by their image similarity to the query’s–the image representation may constraint the latent space, abstract the language of the query and that of the document and be able to capture semantics that are otherwise difficult to encode in textual form. The image representation of queries and documents also offers explainability when it comes to explaining the rankings of the system; which is becoming increasingly important in machine learning-based systems.</p>

                <p>Recent years have witnessed a persistent interest in generating pseudo test collections, both for training and evaluation purposes. We describe a method for generating queries and relevance judgments for microblog search in an unsupervised way. Our starting point is this intuition: tweets with a hashtag are relevant to the topic covered by the hashtag and hence to a suitable query derived from the hashtag. Our baseline method selects all commonly used hashtags, and all associated tweets as relevance judgments; we then generate a query from these tweets. Next, we generate a timestamp for each query, allowing us to use temporal information in the training process. We then enrich the generation process with knowledge derived from an editorial test collection for microblog search.
